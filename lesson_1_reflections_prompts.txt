   A good rule of thumb is to make one commit per logical change. For example, if you fixed a typo, then fixed a bug in a separate part of the file, you should use one commit for each change since they are logically separate.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log: give you the entire history of commit
git diff (current commit id) (earlier commit id): tell you all the changes that are made on the (current commit)
